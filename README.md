The main code sections are divided into 2 parts. When running the ipynbs, please run them from start to finish to ensure are prequisite files are properly generated.
Bankrupt_Clustering.ipynb and Cancer_Clustering.ipynb contain the code that runs all of the feature transformation experiments. These files will need to be run before the Classification files can be run.
Bankrupt_Classification.ipynb and Cancer_Classification.ipynb contain the code that runs all of the classification experiments.

Both of these code secitons will drop images and json outputs directly into the main folder. To view a previous run that has been organized already, check the Bankruptcy and the Cancer folders.
